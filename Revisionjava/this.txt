Java is a high-level, class-based, objec
t-oriented programming language that is
designed to have as few implementation d
ependencies as possible. It is a general
-purpose programming language intended to
let programmers write once, run anywhere (W
ORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code ca
n run on all platforms that support Java wit
hout the need to recompile.[18] Java applicat
ions are typically compiled to bytecode that
can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) reg
ardless of the underlying computer architectur
e. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++,
but has fewer low-level facilities than either
of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capab
ilities (such as reflection and runtime code modi
fication) that are typically not available in traditio
nal compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most
popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[citation not found][19]
[20] particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million develope
rs.[21]
